## Introduction
I think the obfuscated [The International Obfuscated C Code Contest](https://www.ioccc.org/) is one of the coolest things in programming.

Inspired by this I started to write obfuscated "Hello World"" programs in C# a couple years ago.

There are not many fancy things you can do in C#, but one can still cause some chaos.

This is one of them.
